## Contributing to ArcWiki 

ArcWiki is an open-source project licensed under the GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3). We welcome contributions from the community and encourage you to participate in its development! This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to ArcWiki while adhering to the GPLv3 license.

**Understanding GPLv3**

By contributing to ArcWiki, you agree to license your contributions under the GPLv3. This means your code will be freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute under the terms of the GPLv3. You can find the full license text here: [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).

**Getting Started**

* **Fork the Repository:** Create a fork of the ArcWiki repository on GitHub. This allows you to make your own changes and submit them for review.
* **Clone Your Fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

**Making Changes**

1. **Identify an Issue:** Browse the existing issues in the ArcWiki repository. Look for issues labeled `bug` or `enhancement` that you'd like to work on. You can also suggest new features by creating a new issue.
2. **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your changes. This helps keep your work isolated from the main codebase. Use a descriptive branch name that reflects the issue you're addressing (e.g., `fix-login-issue`).
3. **Implement Your Changes:** Make your changes to the codebase. Follow the coding style conventions used in the project (if any).
4. **Write Unit Tests:** If applicable, write unit tests for your changes to ensure they don't break existing functionality.
5. **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages that describe what each commit does.
6. **Push Your Changes:** Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.

**Submitting Pull Requests**

1. **Open a Pull Request:** Once you've pushed your changes, open a pull request from your branch to the main branch of the ArcWiki repository.
2. **Fill Out the Pull Request Template:** GitHub might have a pre-defined template for pull requests. Fill out the details as instructed, clearly explaining the changes you've made and the issue you're addressing.
3. **Respond to Feedback:** Reviewers will provide feedback on your pull request. Address any comments or suggestions promptly.

**Coding Style and Conventions**

* If the project has a documented coding style guide, follow those conventions for consistency.
* Use clear and descriptive variable and function names.
* Write well-commented code to improve readability and maintainability.

**Testing**

* Make sure your changes pass all existing unit tests before submitting a pull request.
* Consider writing additional unit tests for your own modifications.

**Code Reviews**

All pull requests will be reviewed by other developers before being merged into the main codebase. This ensures the quality and maintainability of the code. Be prepared to address any feedback or suggestions from reviewers.

**Reporting Security Vulnerabilities**

If you discover a security vulnerability in ArcWiki, please don't disclose it publicly. Instead, follow the instructions in the [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) file (if it exists) or contact the ArcWiki security team directly.

**Additional Resources**

* ArcWiki Wiki (if applicable)
* Go Programming Language Documentation: [https://go.dev/doc/](https://go.dev/doc/)
